# Spotify streaming analysis

This is my attempt of analyzing my streaming history of spotidy during the year of 2020. I used an access to Spotify's API using Python to wrangle the streaming hisotry files and get features for analysis.

Requirements:

  * Only installing the `spotipy` package fro accessing the API using Python. To install it just run your standard line using pip or another package manager of your choosing:

  ```python
  pip install spotipy
  ```


Data:
* If you want to get your own streaming history you can request it on your Spotify account under the privacy settings and you should be on a webpage similar to this right here:
